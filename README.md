======================================================

Lesson 7-1: Graphing Systems of Equations
-----------------------------------------

* Solve a system of equations by graphing
* Classify a system of equations by graphing
* Solve a system of equations by graphing: word problems
* Is (x, y) a solution to the system of equations?
* Find the number of solutions to a system of equations by graphing

###Quiz:

What type of system is represented by the following equations?

y = 3x - 4 y = 6x - 8

\[( )\] Consistent and Dependent \[(X)\] Inconsistent \[( )\] Consistent and Independent \[\[?\]\] Check the slopes and y-intercepts of the equations \[\[?\]\] Remember that inconsistent systems have no solution

Given the system of equations, how many solutions are there?

y = 2x + 1 y = -x + 3

\[( )\] 0 \[(X)\] 1 \[( )\] Infinite \[\[?\]\] Find the point of intersection (if any) \[\[?\]\] Notice that the slopes are different

Solve the following system of equations by graphing:

y = 4x - 3 y = 2x + 1

\[( )\] (1, 1) \[(X)\] (2, 5) \[( )\] No solution \[\[?\]\] Graph both lines and find the intersection points \[\[?\]\] Be cautious of the signs when graphing

Is (3, 4) a solution to the following system of equations?

y = x + 1 y = 2x - 2

\[(X)\] Yes \[( )\] No \[\[?\]\] Substitute x = 3 and y = 4 into both equations \[\[?\]\] Check if the coordinate pair satisfies both equations

A system of equations is graphed on the coordinate plane. If the lines coincide, how many solutions does the system have?

\[( )\] 0 \[( )\] 1 \[(X)\] Infinite \[\[?\]\] Understand the characteristics of coinciding lines \[\[?\]\] Remember that coinciding lines share all points in common

Solve the following word problem using graphing:

Sam sells cookies for $2 each and brownies for $3 each. She wants to earn at least $100 in a day. If she sells 40 items in total, how many of each should she sell to achieve her goal?

y = number of cookies x = number of brownies

y = 40 - x 2y + 3x >= 100

\[( )\] 20 cookies, 20 brownies \[(X)\] 10 cookies, 30 brownies \[( )\] 30 cookies, 10 brownies \[\[?\]\] Graph both equations and find the region satisfying the inequality \[\[?\]\] Look for integer coordinates within the feasible region

###Solution Page:

1. What type of system is represented by the following equations? y = 3x - 4 y = 6x - 8

Solution: Inconsistent

Explanation: To classify the system, we need to compare the slopes and y-intercepts of the given equations. The first equation has a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of -4, while the second equation has a slope of 6 and a y-intercept of -8. Since the slopes are different, the lines will never intersect, and there is no solution. This makes the system inconsistent.

Analogy: Imagine two runners on separate tracks. If they are running at different speeds, they will never be at the same place at the same time. The same concept applies to the lines in this system of equations.

2. Given the system of equations, how many solutions are there? y = 2x + 1 y = -x + 3

Solution: 1

Explanation: Since the slopes of the equations are different (2 and -1), the lines will intersect at a single point. This means there is one unique solution to the system of equations.

Analogy: Picture two roads that cross each other at one point. At that point, the two roads meet, representing the unique solution to the system of equations.

3. Solve the following system of equations by graphing: y = 4x - 3 y = 2x + 1

Solution: (2, 5)

Explanation: To solve the system, we need to find the point where the two lines intersect. When we graph the equations, we can see that they intersect at the point (2, 5). This point is the unique solution to the system.

Analogy: Imagine two laser beams originating from different locations and pointing in different directions. When the beams cross, they create a single point of intersection, just like the lines in the graph.

4. Is (3, 4) a solution to the following system of equations? y = x + 1 y = 2x - 2

Solution: Yes

Explanation: To check if the coordinate pair (3, 4) is a solution to the system, substitute x = 3 and y = 4 into both equations. If the coordinate pair satisfies both equations, it is a solution. In this case, both equations are true, so (3, 4) is a solution to the system.

Analogy: Think of the system of equations as a combination lock, and the coordinate pair as the correct combination. If the pair opens both locks (i.e., satisfies both equations), it's the correct combination.

5. A system of equations is graphed on the coordinate plane. If the lines coincide, how many solutions does the system have?

Solution: Infinite

Explanation: When the lines coincide, they share all points in common. This means that every point on the line is a solution to the system of equations, and there are infinitely many solutions.

Analogy: Imagine two identical, transparent sheets of paper with the same line drawn on them. If you lay one on top of the other, you won't be able to tell the difference between the lines. In this case, there are infinitely many points where the lines coincide, just like the solutions to the system.

6. Solve the following word problem using graphing: Sam sells cookies for $2 each and brownies for $3 each. She wants to earn at least $100 in a day. If she sells 40 items in total, how many of each should she sell to achieve her goal?

Solution: 10 cookies, 30 brownies

Explanation: To solve this problem, we can graph both equations

### Checkpoint opportunity

Module 7

1. Checkpoint: Systems of equations and inequalities
2. Checkpoint: Represent constraints

## Quizzes

Throughout the module, there will be quizzes to test your knowledge on the topics we have covered. These quizzes will help you assess your understanding and identify areas where you may need to review.

## Active Learning Strategies

During the virtual lecture, we will use active learning strategies to engage with the material and deepen our understanding. These strategies may include group discussions, problem-solving activities, and interactive simulations.

## Conclusion

By the end of this module, you should have a strong foundation in Algebra 1 and be able to apply your knowledge to solve real-world problems.
