# Algebra 1 

Module 7: Systems of Linear Equations and Inequalities
======================================================

Lesson 7-1: Graphing Systems of Equations
-----------------------------------------

* Solve a system of equations by graphing
* Classify a system of equations by graphing
* Solve a system of equations by graphing: word problems
* Is (x, y) a solution to the system of equations?
* Find the number of solutions to a system of equations by graphing


### Quiz

1. To solve a system of equations by graphing, you should:

   [(X)] Graph both equations on the same coordinate plane
   [( )] Graph each equation on separate coordinate planes
   [( )] Solve for one variable in both equations and then compare the solutions
   [( )] Multiply both equations by each other

   [[?]] You need to find the point of intersection between the two equations.

2. Classify the following system of equations by graphing:



y = x + 2
y = -x + 2



[( )] One solution
[(X)] No solution
[( )] Infinitely many solutions

[[?]] The slopes of the two equations are different, but their y-intercepts are the same.

3. Solve the following word problem using graphing:

A store sells two types of fruit: apples and oranges. The price of an apple is $1, and the price of an orange is $2. The store sells a total of 10 fruits for a total of $15. How many apples and oranges were sold?

[( )] 5 apples, 5 oranges
[(X)] 5 apples, 3 oranges
[( )] 3 apples, 7 oranges
[( )] 7 apples, 3 oranges

[[?]] You can set up a system of equations and graph them to find the point of intersection.

4. Determine if the coordinate pair (3, 4) satisfies the following system of equations:



x + y = 7
2x - y = 2



[(X)] Yes
[( )] No

[[?]] Substitute the x and y values into both equations and check if they are true.

5. Identify the number of solutions to the following system of equations through graphical analysis:



3x - y = 1
6x - 2y = 2



[( )] One solution
[( )] No solution
[(X)] Infinitely many solutions

[[?]] Check if the equations are multiples of each other, which would mean they represent the same line.

### Solutions Page


1. To solve a system of equations by graphing, you should:

   [(X)] Graph both equations on the same coordinate plane

   By graphing both equations on the same coordinate plane, you can easily identify the point of intersection, which represents the solution to the system of equations.

2. Classify the following system of equations by graphing:



y = x + 2
y = -x + 2



[(X)] No solution

The two lines are parallel and have the same y-intercept but different slopes, so they will never intersect. This means there is no solution to the system.

3. Solve the following word problem using graphing:

A store sells two types of fruit: apples and oranges. The price of an apple is $1, and the price of an orange is $2. The store sells a total of 10 fruits for a total of $15. How many apples and oranges were sold?

[(X)] 5 apples, 3 oranges

We can set up a system of equations like this:


a + o = 10
1a + 2o = 15


Graphing the equations, we find that the point of intersection is (5, 3), which means 5 apples and 3 oranges were sold.

4. Determine if the coordinate pair (3, 4) satisfies the following system of equations:



x + y = 7
2x - y = 2



[(X)] Yes

By substituting x = 3 and y = 4 into both equations, we get:


3 + 4 = 7
2(3) - 4 = 2


Both equations are true, so the coordinate pair (3, 4) satisfies the system of equations.

5. Identify the number of solutions to the following system of equations through graphical analysis:



3x - y = 1
6x - 2y = 2



[(X)] Infinitely many solutions

The second equation is a multiple of the first equation (2 times the first equation), so they represent the same line. This means there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line satisfies both equations.

### Lesson 7-2: Substitution


* Solve a system of equations using substitution
* Solve a system of equations using substitution: word problems
* Find the number of solutions to a system of equations


In which method do you replace a variable with an equivalent expression in order to solve a system of equations?

[(X)] Substitution
[( )] Elimination
[( )] Gaussian elimination
[( )] Cramer's rule
[[?]] Think about which method involves replacing a variable with an expression

When solving a system of equations using substitution, what's the first step?

[( )] Multiply both equations by their least common multiples
[(X)] Solve one of the equations for one of the variables
[( )] Add the equations together to eliminate one variable
[( )] Divide one equation by the other to eliminate a variable
[[?]] Focus on the method that isolates a variable first

Consider the following system of equations:

x + y = 6

x - y = 2

Use substitution to solve for x and y.

[[x = 4, y = 2]]
[[?]] Solve one equation for one variable
[[?]] Substitute the expression into the other equation
[[?]] Solve for the remaining variable
[[?]] Don't forget to check your solution in both equations

Solve the following word problem using substitution:

Molly and Kevin have a total of 47 candies. Molly has 3 more candies than Kevin. How many candies does each of them have?

[[Molly = 25, Kevin = 22]]
[[?]] Create a system of equations based on the problem
[[?]] Solve one equation for one variable
[[?]] Substitute the expression into the other equation and solve
[[?]] Make sure the number of candies adds up to 47


## Lesson 7-3: Elimination using Addition and Subtraction


* Solve a system of equations by adding or subtracting
* Classify a system of equations

## Lesson 7-4: Elimination Using Multiplication


* Solve a system of equations using elimination

* Solve systems of linear inequalities by graphing

### Checkpoint opportunity

Module 7

1. Checkpoint: Systems of equations and inequalities
2. Checkpoint: Represent constraints

## Quizzes

Throughout the module, there will be quizzes to test your knowledge on the topics we have covered. These quizzes will help you assess your understanding and identify areas where you may need to review.

## Active Learning Strategies

During the virtual lecture, we will use active learning strategies to engage with the material and deepen our understanding. These strategies may include group discussions, problem-solving activities, and interactive simulations.

## Conclusion

By the end of this module, you should have a strong foundation in Algebra 1 and be able to apply your knowledge to solve real-world problems.
