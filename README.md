### Solutions Page


1. To solve a system of equations by graphing, you should:

   [(X)] Graph both equations on the same coordinate plane

   By graphing both equations on the same coordinate plane, you can easily identify the point of intersection, which represents the solution to the system of equations.

2. Classify the following system of equations by graphing:



y = x + 2

y = -x + 2



[(X)] No solution

The two lines are parallel and have the same y-intercept but different slopes, so they will never intersect. This means there is no solution to the system.

3. Solve the following word problem using graphing:

A store sells two types of fruit: apples and oranges. The price of an apple is $1, and the price of an orange is $2. The store sells a total of 10 fruits for a total of $15. How many apples and oranges were sold?

[(X)] 5 apples, 3 oranges

We can set up a system of equations like this:


a + o = 10
1a + 2o = 15


Graphing the equations, we find that the point of intersection is (5, 3), which means 5 apples and 3 oranges were sold.

4. Determine if the coordinate pair (3, 4) satisfies the following system of equations:



x + y = 7
2x - y = 2



[(X)] Yes

By substituting x = 3 and y = 4 into both equations, we get:


3 + 4 = 7
2(3) - 4 = 2


Both equations are true, so the coordinate pair (3, 4) satisfies the system of equations.

5. Identify the number of solutions to the following system of equations through graphical analysis:



3x - y = 1
6x - 2y = 2



[(X)] Infinitely many solutions

The second equation is a multiple of the first equation (2 times the first equation), so they represent the same line. This means there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line satisfies both equations.

### Lesson 7-2: - Solutions

In which method do you replace a variable with an equivalent expression in order to solve a system of equations?

Answer: Substitution

In the substitution method, we solve one equation for one variable and then replace that variable with the equivalent expression in the other equation to solve for the remaining variable.

When solving a system of equations using substitution, what's the first step?

Answer: Solve one of the equations for one of the variables

The first step in the substitution method is to solve one of the equations for one of the variables, which will allow you to substitute the expression into the other equation.

Consider the following system of equations:

x + y = 6

x - y = 2

Use substitution to solve for x and y.

Answer: x = 4, y = 2

First, solve one equation for one variable, e.g., the first equation for x:
x = 6 - y

Now, substitute this expression into the second equation:
(6 - y) - y = 2

Solve for y:
6 - 2y = 2
2y = 4
y = 2

Finally, substitute the value of y back into the expression for x:
x = 6 - 2 = 4

So, x = 4 and y = 2.

Solve the following word problem using substitution:

Molly and Kevin have a total of 47 candies. Molly has 3 more candies than Kevin. How many candies does each of them have?

Answer: Molly = 25, Kevin = 22

First, create a system of equations based on the problem:

M + K = 47 (total candies)
M = K + 3 (Molly has 3 more candies than Kevin)

Solve one equation for one variable (e.g., the second equation for M):
M = K + 3

Substitute the expression into the other equation:
(K + 3) + K = 47

Solve for K:
2K + 3 = 47
2K = 44
K = 22

Finally, substitute the value of K back into the expression for M:
M = 22 + 3 = 25

So, Molly has 25 candies, and Kevin has 22 candies.

[[?]] Look for a variable with the same or opposite coefficients
[[?]] Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable
[[?]] Solve for the remaining variable
[[?]] Don't forget to check your solution in both equations

### Lesson 7-3: - Solutions



In which method do you eliminate a variable by adding or subtracting equations?

Answer: Elimination

The elimination method involves combining equations to eliminate one variable, making it easier to solve the system of equations.

When using elimination, what should you do first if the coefficients of a variable are not the same in both equations?

Answer: Multiply one or both equations by a constant to make the coefficients equal

To use the elimination method effectively, you need to have equal coefficients for a variable. You can achieve this by multiplying one or both equations by a constant.



To solve the system of equations:

–3x + 4y = 18

2x − 4y = –8

using elimination, follow these steps:

1. Add the two equations together to eliminate y:

   –3x + 4y + 2x − 4y = 18 – 8

2. Simplify to get:

   –x = 10

3. Solve for x by dividing both sides by –1:

   x = –10

4. Substitute x = –10 into one of the equations to solve for y:

   2x − 4y = –8

   2(–10) − 4y = –8

   –20 − 4y = –8

5. Simplify and solve for y:

   –4y = –8 + 20

   –4y = 12

   y = –3

6. Check the solution by substituting x = –10 and y = –3 into both equations:

   –3(–10) + 4(–3) = 18

   2(–10) − 4(–3) = –8

   Both equations are true, so the solution is x = –10 and y = –3.



To solve the system of equations:

–2x − 6y = –16

–2x − 5y = –10

using elimination, follow these steps:

1. Multiply the second equation by –1 to make the x terms add together and eliminate x:

   –2x − 6y = –16
    2x + 5y =  10  (multiplied by –1)

   Adding the two equations, we get:

   –y = –6

2. Solve for y by dividing both sides by –1:

   y = 6

3. Substitute y = 6 into one of the equations to solve for x. We can use either equation, but the first one is simpler:

   –2x − 6y = –16

   Substituting y = 6, we get:

   –2x − 6(6) = –16

   Simplifying, we get:

   –2x = 20

4. Solve for x by dividing both sides by –2:

   x = –10

5. Check the solution by substituting x = –10 and y = 6 into both equations:

   –2(–10) − 6(6) = –16
   –2(–10) − 5(6) = –10

   Simplifying, we get:

   8 = 8
   4 = 4

   Both equations are true, so the solution is x = –10 and y = 6.

###  Lesson 7-4: - Solution

Which method involves multiplying one or both equations by a constant to make the coefficients equal before adding or subtracting to eliminate a variable?

Correct answer: Elimination using multiplication

Explanation: Elimination using multiplication involves multiplying one or both equations by a constant to make the coefficients of one variable equal or opposite. Then, the equations can be added or subtracted to eliminate that variable and solve the system of equations.


Solve the following word problem using elimination:

At a sports event, there are 3 times as many adults as children. Together, there are 80 people. How many adults and children are there?

Correct answer: Adults = 60, Children = 20

Solution:
Create a system of equations based on the problem:

A = 3C

A + C = 80

Eliminate variable A by substitution:

3C + C = 80
4C = 80
C = 20

Now, substitute C back into one of the equations to find A:

A + 20 = 80
A = 60

There are 60 adults and 20 children.

Solve the following system of equations using any method:

2x - y = 1

x + y = 5

Correct answer: x = 2, y = 3

Solution (using elimination):

Add the two equations to eliminate variable y:

(2x - y) + (x + y) = 1 + 5
3x = 6
x = 2

Now, substitute x back into one of the equations to find y:

2 + y = 5

y = 3

Check the solution (x = 2, y = 3) in both equations.

Solve the following word problem using any method:

At a party, the total number of hamburgers and hotdogs served was 50. Each hamburger cost $3, and each hotdog cost $2. The total cost was $120. How many hamburgers and hotdogs were served?

Correct answer: Hamburgers = 20, Hotdogs = 30

Solution (using substitution or elimination):

Create a system of equations based on the problem:

H + D = 50

3H + 2D = 120

Using substitution or elimination method, solve the system of equations:

Substituting D = 50 - H into the second equation:

3H + 2(50 - H) = 120
3H + 100 - 2H = 120
H = 20

Now, substitute H back into one of the equations to find D:

20 + D = 50
D = 30

There were 20 hamburgers and 30 hotdogs served.

[[?]] Write "The solution region is below the line BLANK and above the line BLANK"

### Lesson 7-5: - Solutions

What is the main difference between solving a system of linear equations and a system of linear inequalities?

Correct Answer: The solutions are regions instead of specific points.

Explanation: While solving a system of linear equations results in specific points where the lines intersect, solving a system of linear inequalities results in a region of the coordinate plane where all the inequalities are true simultaneously.

Is (3, 2) a solution to the following system of linear inequalities?

y > 2x - 1

y < -x + 4

Correct Answer: Yes

Explanation: Plug the point (3, 2) into both inequalities:

2 > 2(3) - 1 -> 2 > 6 - 1 -> 2 > 5 (True)
2 < -3 + 4 -> 2 < 1 (True)

Since both inequalities are true for the given point, (3, 2) is a solution to the system of linear inequalities.

Solve the following system of linear inequalities by graphing:

y ≥ -2x + 5

y < 1/3x + 3

Correct Answer: The solution region is above the line y = -2x + 5 and below the line y = 1/3x + 3.

Explanation: Graph both inequalities on a coordinate plane. The solution region is where both inequalities are true. In this case, it is the region above the line y = -2x + 5 and below the line y = 1/3x + 3. You can verify the solution by testing points within the region.

Which of the following is NOT a step in solving systems of linear inequalities by graphing?

Correct Answer: Eliminating one variable

Explanation: Eliminating one variable is a technique used in solving systems of linear equations, not inequalities. When solving systems of linear inequalities by graphing, the steps include graphing the inequality lines on a coordinate plane, identifying the solution region, and testing points within the region to verify the solution.

Solve the following system of linear inequalities by graphing:

x + y ≤ 5

2x - y ≥ 1

Correct Answer: The solution region is below the line x + y = 5 and above the line 2x - y = 1.

Explanation: Graph both inequalities on a coordinate plane. The solution region is where both inequalities are true. In this case, it is the region below the line x + y = 5 and above the line 2x - y = 1. You can verify the solution by testing points within the region.
